# Fuel

Optionally, instead of funding the BTC fees for every distribution seperately,
you may deposit BTC into a single ```fuel address``` which can then be used
to automatically fund future transactions. 

This allows you (from a users perspective) to trigger distributions using only one transaction (sending the tokens)
instead of two (tokens + fee).   
Make sure to set ```use_fuel``` to true on your distributions.
