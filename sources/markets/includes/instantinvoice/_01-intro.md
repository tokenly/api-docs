#Instant Invoices

"Instant Invoices" or "Instant Checkout" is a feature that allows for generic bitcoin/token/credit payment collection on any website or app.
This is similar to instant checkout functionality on Stripe or Paypal.

For pricing, refer to "standard item" invoice pricing on your Markets dashboard.

For front end implementation, refer to our javascript SDK here: https://github.com/tokenly/markets-instant-invoice
